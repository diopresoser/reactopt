## Boys Over Flowers: A Classic Story with a Modern Twist
 
Boys Over Flowers is based on the Japanese manga Hana Yori Dango, which has been adapted into several live-action versions in different countries, such as Taiwan, China, India, and Thailand. The Korean version is considered one of the most successful and popular adaptations, as it captured the essence of the original story while adding its own charm and flavor.
 
The story revolves around Geum Jan Di, a cheerful and optimistic girl who works as a delivery person for her family's dry cleaning business. She has a strong sense of justice and does not hesitate to help others in need. One day, she saves a student from jumping off the roof of Shinhwa High School, a prestigious school for the wealthy elite. As a reward, she receives a scholarship to attend the school herself, much to her dismay.
 
At Shinhwa High School, she encounters the F4, a group of four boys who are the heirs of the most powerful families in Korea. They are Gu Jun Pyo, the leader and the son of the Shinhwa Group president; Yoon Ji Hoo, a quiet and gentle musician who is the grandson of a former president; So Yi Jung, a skilled potter and a notorious playboy; and Song Woo Bin, a friendly and loyal businessman who has connections to the underworld. The F4 have absolute authority over the school and bully anyone who defies them. They also issue red cards to their targets, which means that the whole school will ostracize and harass them until they leave.
 
Jan Di refuses to bow down to the F4 and challenges their leader, Jun Pyo. This sparks his interest in her and he begins to pursue her romantically. However, Jan Di develops feelings for Ji Hoo, who is Jun Pyo's best friend and rival. This creates a complicated love triangle that is further complicated by the interference of Jun Pyo's mother, Kang Hee Soo, who disapproves of Jan Di and tries to separate them. Along the way, Jan Di also befriends Yi Jung and Woo Bin, who help her cope with the difficulties she faces at school and in her personal life.
